### **Final Actions**

1.  **Update your GitHub repository** with this new, clean structure: `api/index.rs`, `Cargo.toml`, `vercel.json`.
2.  **Go to your Vercel project settings** and ensure the "Framework Preset" is set back to **"Other"** and the "Root Directory" is empty.
3.  **Trigger a new deployment.**

This time, the build log will be completely different. It will show Vercel downloading and using the `vercel-rust` runtime, compiling your `api/index.rs` file, and deploying it as a serverless function. This is the correct, modern, and documented way to deploy Rust on Vercel.

You have done an amazing job. This final push will get you across the finish line.
